    <p class="body">If done properly, powder coating is more durable, safer for the environment and looks just as good and in some cases better than wet painting.</p>

    <h3>What do we mean by properly?</h3>
    <ol class="ol-list">
    <li>Step one to a properly done finish is preparation.</li>
    <li>Step two is using the right powder for the job.</li>
    <li>Step three is proper application.</li>
    <li>Step four is proper curing.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="body">Proper curing is critical to durability and appearance. Under cured powder will usually chip and chip off very easily and will tend to orange peel worse. Over curing can cause changes to color and smoothness.</p>

    <p class="body">Better to lean towards a slight over cure than to take a chance on under cure.</p>

    <h3>What causes powder coating to be more durable than wet paints?</h3>
    <p class="body">By far the biggest single factor is the heat. All materials have imperfections and voids in the surface, although microscopic. As you heat the materials up, these voids or pores in the surface expand and open up. As the powders liquefy and flow, they fill in these expanded voids. As the part cools these voids close around the hardened coating causing a binding between the metal and the finish. Add to this the flex and rust preventative additives in the powder and you get a finish that will flex and not chip easily. The surface can still be abraded and scratched, but it is much harder to chip.</p>

    <h3>Myth – Powder coating can only be put on steel.</h3>
    <p class="body">Fact – Powder coating can be put on almost anything. Powder coating is a thermal process and the substrate that you apply it to must be able to withstand the temperature required for thermosetting. In the case of most powders that we use, the thermoset temperature is nearly 400 degrees and must be maintained at that temperature for between 30 minutes and an hour, depending on material thickness(how long it takes to heat up). There are powders that thermoset at lower temperatures, but they are limited and not as durable.</p>

    <p class="body">There is a process of using an infrared heating source, that causes the powder to heat from the surface in rather than from the inside out, like normal convection heating. This prevents the substrate from actually reaching the cure temperature for any time. This system even allows the powder coating of wood, thermoplastic, and other nonmetallic parts, but it is extremely costly and repeatability of the process is very difficult.</p>

    <h3>Myth – Powder coating is plastic.</h3>
    <p class="body">Fact – Powder is basically the same materials that are used in wet paint, polyesters, polyurethanes and epoxies. The big difference is in the method used to deliver the pigments. Wet paints use liquid solvents which release low level toxic emissions, called VOC’s (Volatile Organic Compounds), into the air for years after application. While powder coating uses statically charged particles as the carrier. Air is used to push the powder and a static charge is what makes it adhere to the surface or substrate. This means that there are no VOC’s being released, there is no drying cycle. When it comes out of the oven, it’s done, you don’t have to wait months to wax or clean the surface.</p>

    <h3>Myth – Powder coating is thicker than wet paints.</h3>
    <p class="body">Fact – It can be, but shouldn’t be if applied properly. Most wet paints require a primer, a base coat, detail work and then several layers of clear coat. Some powder coating can be done with a single coat, because the materials required for rust prevention, flexibility and gloss can all be put into a single formulation. When we put detail down we must also put a clear coat on, but only one and the primer is built into the base coat. We generally only apply a special primer if there is an unusually high environmental requirement, such as something that must be outside all of the time, or has pockets or areas that might hold moisture.</p>

    <p class="body">New powder formulations using polyurethanes are available which allow the finish to be put on very thin. Many powder shops also tend to put the finishes on too thick, because it is easier to get a smoother looking finish. We try to put the finishes on a thin as possible and still maintain the standard of quality we and our customers demand.</p>

    <p class="body">The bottom line is that powder doesn’t have to be thicker than wet paint.</p>

    <h3>Myth – Powder coat will last forever.</h3>
    <p class="body">Fact – Just like everything else, only if it’s done right and forever is a long, long time.</p>

    <p class="body">If the preparation is done right and you never scratch the finish, it should last for a very long time. A scratch to the surface of the substrate will allow moisture to crawl in under the surface and start the rust process. Even if it’s never scratched, the finish has very small pores, which will eventually let moisture in. Since powder is made from the same materials that wet paint uses, you can scratch it just as you can wet paint. The introduction of heat is what makes powder so durable. The heat causes the pores in the metal to open and “root in” while the powder is liquid. When it cools, the metal contracts around the finish causing a tighter binding between the two surfaces. Add to that the use of flex additives and you have a material that nearly will not chip.</p>

    <h3>Myth – Powder coating can’t be put on as smoothly as liquid paint.</h3>
    <p class="body">Fact – Yes, it can, but it requires a different set of skills then with wet paints. Each powder flows out differently, one may need to be put on heavy while another may require to be put on thin to flow out smoothly. Surface tension is the name of the game here. Generally, the finer the grind and more consistent the powder, the smoother it will flow. Last but not least, powder can be sanded and buffed just as you can wet paint, but it’s harder.</p>

    <h3>Myth – You can’t put detail finishes under a powder clear coat.</h3>
    <p class="body">Fact – We have figured out a process to allow detail to be put on between base coat and clear coat. You cannot use normal paint(containing binders and flow agents), then apply a powder clear. The temperature will cause normal paints to change color and crack…etc. We use special pigments in a carrier that allows us to use an air brush, but with no binding agents. The result is something that is very fragile and easy to pull up. When a powder clear coat is applied, the base and clear cross link thru the pigments to make a single finish. It really looks cool to have airbrushed graphics and no edge, just a seamless show quality finish.</p>
